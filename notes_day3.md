##Permissions
Need to make giving permissions more fine grained:
  Give people partial or full access
    Partial access --> can see item
    Full access --> can edit/delete

##Team creation
  Admins should be able to create teams
  Then can add teams to notes
  Everyone on the team has permission to view/whatever the note

##Category permissions
  When a person has permission to one category, he has permissions to all the child categories

##Stats for users
  Admins can see user stats:
    Shows how many photos/notes they've uploaded this week
    Shows how many photos/notes they have

##At homepage
  Show user all stuff user has uploaded
  On far right hand side --> show all things User has access (viewing/edit) to.
  Sort by:
    1) date last updated
    2) alphabetical

##Categories index page
  Category Links are small
  Category links need to show how many subcategories are in it

  Sign-Out button needs to be in nav bar or somewhere out of the way. Smaller maybe?

  On category show -->
    Show what category you are in

    If I'm in 3 categories deep, show the path getting there so I can click any part of the path and go to that category

    Photos left-hand column, notes right-hand column
    one column all the way across --> show all subcategories

##Users
  Name should be a link
  Name should be capitalized
  Name should be sorted alphabetically
  Should show how many notes/photos they uploaded

  Add tags & search results
